AtmosphereFull2017,Small but illustrative example of whats going on at the State Dept I know someone who a few years ago did an unpaid summer internship at an embassy overseas It was a country where the govt is very hostile to us but the common people love everything about the United States from movies to music to the NBA but mostly the people love the US despite their own govts propaganda because they see us as everything their own country is not One of this persons duties for the summer was to go up on the embassy roof every day and take air quality readings then enter the data into the embassy website It took him about  minutes each morning And apparently the webpage with the air quality data was the most visited page of the entire embassy website even more than the information on visas The reason was that nobody trusted their own govts information on pollution and air quality but they DID trust the US embassy Enter Marco Rubio as SecState the supposed adult in the Trump Romper Room One of his first acts was to order all embassies and consulates to cease posting air quality data on their websites And remember this is something that took  minutes of time for an unpaid intern So much for earning goodwill and making America first for the common people around the world

devdotm,Not trying to be rude but what was the point of this comment when  of the  things you listed are provably worse in European countries air pollution  exposure to microplastics meaning they obviously have nothing to do with the article  data being discussed

rockshox11,In January hundreds of firefighters fanned across Los Angeles County to fight the Palisades and Eaton blazes as they tore through heavily populated communities killing more than two dozen people and destroying thousands of buildings Days after their work some of those firefighters had elevated levels of lead and mercury inside cells in their blood amounts higher than those found in colleagues who had fought earlier forest fires in less populated areas That is an early finding from the LA Fire Health Study a year effort by a consortium of researchers to understand the health effects of exposure to smoke and other pollution from the recent California wildfires The Palisades and Eaton firefighters lead levels were five times higher than the forest firefighters levels and their mercury levels were three times higher said Kari Nadeau the chair of the environmental health department at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and one of the lead researchers on the study Dr Nadeau said she had been alarmed to find that the metals had entered the firefighters cells not just their blood plasma That means the metals can come into contact with cellular DNA potentially causing short and longterm health consequences Lead and mercury exposure have been associated with neurological impairments among other problems but how the firefighters specific exposures will affect them is not clear the researchers will continue to follow them over time The CedarsSinai Medical Center is working to provide treatment to firefighters and the researchers hope their findings could lead doctors to diagnose more people early Quick detection of lead and mercury toxicity is key Dr Nadeau said A therapy called chelation can help prevent the longterm effects but is most effective if administered early The data shared by Dr Nadeau are preliminary They come from only  firefighters and have not yet been published in a peerreviewed paper But Minghao Qiu an assistant professor at Stony Brook University who has studied the health effects of wildfire smoke but was not involved in this study said that he gave quite some weight to the findings He said that they began to answer questions on which data had not been available Previous research had measured toxins in the air but not inside firefighters bodies Research has started to link wildfire smoke to a range of health problems But as climate change has made wildfires more frequent intense and widespread evidence is emerging that the health consequences could differ in kind not just frequency
wiredmagazine,In  the US Embassy in Beijing started regularly tweeting about the air quality in the city which was gearing up to host Chinas first Olympic Games Two times a day the embassy automatically published current pollution levels measured by an air quality monitor installed on its roof in collaboration with the US Environmental Protection Agency The data contradicted the figures published by the local government angering local officials and eventually spurring China to clean up the air in its capital city But on Tuesday a spokesperson for the US State Department told WIRED that the program is abruptly ending due to budget constraints The project eventually became part of a broader highly successful US government initiative known officially as DOSAir which measured pollution levels in about  cities where US diplomatic missions are located around the world Scientists and researchers have credited it with helping clean up the air in dozens of countries preventing up to  premature deaths and saving  million in medical costs per median city annually according to a research paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  For now individual embassies can still run their air monitors the State Department spokesperson said but they will no longer send data back to the agency Historical statistics will continue to be available online but theres no estimated date when realtime data transmissions will resume they added In many countries where these instruments were placed it was the first air quality data ever says Daniel Westervelt a research professor at Columbia Universitys Climate Schools LamontDoherty Earth Observatory That going away is going to hinder research and hinder the advancement of our understanding of the exposure of air pollutants to human health Read the full story httpswwwwiredcomstoryairmonitoringbeijingstatedepartmenthalted

Suddenly_Elmo,What a stupid post Firstly theres no reason at all for it to be bike vs bus we can promote both and both are great Cars take up vastly more road space than bikes and slow buses down far more frequently Fewer cars and more carfree roads will do far more to promote buses than completely eliminating bikes could ever do Secondly relatively few people cycle in London because its dangerous and inconvenient to do so not because they dont want to This is certainly the case for me personally Your argument about the unpopularity of cycling is putting the cart before the horse Improved cycle infrastructure has led to significant increases in the number of people cycling in recent years and doubtless this trend would continue In a poll Londoners overwhelmingly supported the idea of giving over more public space to bikes more in fact than said the same of public transport Its fine if you hate bikes for whatever weird reason but both cyclists and public transport enthusiasts have a mutual enemy in cars why not just focus on them instead
galenwolf,The findings from a longrunning government survey which questioned  people in  comes amid mounting unease on the Labour benches about cuts to disability benefits Right so this isnt a vetted medical survey that was done it was a questionnaire I have a few issues with this  We do not know if the sample size was actually representative for the actual demographics of the UK Out of those it sent the questionnaire to those with more free time might be more inclined to answer and that might sour the results  We do not know how the questionnaire quantified disabled Disabled can be anything from being blind loss of limb or deaf to dyslexia adhd and autism which all vary from inconvenience to severe I am coming at this as someone who is himself has dyslexia and whose brother is also dyslexic  its a pain but doesnt stop me from working I just have to incorporate methods to minimize its effects  We do not know if those who answered answered truthfully through self diagnosis etc I dont think this one needs an explanation self diagnosis is not reliable and without knowing what was on the questionnaire we have no way of knowing if anything was vetted Whilst I dont discount the idea of a high figure of people being disabled I would want to see the data and how they vetted it One thing it bare in mind is whilst anecdotal most of my elderly relatives have issues with their lungs Against whilst going off anecdotal data its also not surprising I would expect a higher degree of lung issues amongst the elderly than the rest of the population The older generations smoked a lot more they also grew up in a time when industrial air pollution was much worse and for the very elderly when a lot of homes still used coke the fuel not the drink or drug for heating They also had less protections against dangerous chemicals My mother was exposed to benzene without a respirator when working in a factory I have other relatives who used Benzene in the s and they had full PPE because of how dangerous that stuff is which contributed to her COPD My dad used to say I could put on a bleach white handkerchief over my face as a kid and walk down the road and by the end of it it was black due to the smoke he died of lung cancer Like I said that is anecdotal so a medical professional weighing would help Edit Fixed the now glaring spelling mistakes
margazi_perumal_20,No that data isnt accurate and there is no way you can get the accurate measurements and generalize it AQI measurement stations are installed at specific locations of the city and the readings you get are from those stations and it highly depends on the place it is installed if you have that device installed at a place very next to the main roadconstruction site readings will be worse for the whole area if you install it inside a stable residential area with greenary and clean roads  your readings will be less and again it cant be generalized for the whole area Air pollution has a localised effect  me sitting in Malleshwaram shouldnt worry about the AQI reading in Whitefield instead I should look for AQI in my own locality my house and my street These are managed by KSPCB and better purchase your own sensing device as its the good way since AQI is a localised thing
three-one-seven,Sure Id love to have a reasonable discussion about this but your reply did not set that tone at all starting with the statement that youre going to call your representatives and take the opposite stance of what I was advocating You then followed that up with statements about taxpayers paying state worker wages which is of course true but is not typically the precursor to a reasonable discussion and implies hostility There are indeed a lot of people out there who do have a crab in a bucket mentality and wish to drag others down because their own situation sucks and your tone suggested that might be you Thats a good segue to my first point I think you should support WFH for state workers because whenever any workers get a win it makes it easier for other workers to get wins as well and then its like a snowball effect that results in better working conditions overall for everyone You can see examples of that when you compare California with states which have far fewer worker protections and worse working conditions Where do you think that all came from It wasnt an accident It was the result of labor fighting for better conditions and improving things for everyone one win at a time WFH is an enormous upgrade in working conditions and worklife balance for tens of millions of workers which is why the oligarch class is trying so desperately to roll it back Next Ill address your points about covid and pollution Im sure youre familiar with unanticipated andor unintended downstream effects that can result when something happens right Well thats what happened here do you remember all those photos of the super clean air right after covid struck and we were all in lockdown Well while youre absolutely right that WFH started because of covid we saw the benefits of taking all those cars off the road pretty much immediately Traffic was basically not a thing and the air was much cleaner So while the original intent of WFH was to stop the spread of covid I think its very reasonable to continue it for the benefits we realized that werent related to covid And besides WFH still reduces the spread of infectious diseases by not forcing office workers into close proximity with each other for no good reason Theres also the traffic and parking issues that affect everyone not just state workers Every state worker who could WFH but is forced into an office is another car on the freeway another parking spot taken another idiot looking at their phone at a stoplight and not going when it turns green etc I aspire to spend as little time in traffic and searching for parking as possible dont you We know there is an alternative where the work still gets done but all of the bullshit associated with commuting is just not a part of our lives Who wouldnt want that Then theres the financial burden that this imposes on individuals many of whom were hired as remote workers and successfully worked remotely for several years prior to RTO Adding a commute where there was none costs several thousand dollars per year and chews through literal weeks of a persons free time all for no good reason Thats just a shitty thing to do to people when theres no reasonable justification for it Thats time that people never get back that couldve been spent on anything else but instead were being forced to spend it sitting in traffic You mentioned taxpayers earlier have you considered the cost to taxpayers for all of the things the state will have to spend money on to facilitate RTO Many agencies cut down significantly or even terminated their leases on office space Not only that but there are not enough workstations to accommodate the workforce so those will have to be purchased as well These costs can be avoided entirely by continuing telework which we know was working well because the state kept data on it until Newsom wanted to RTO and then they took the site down In other words RTO will cost a bunch of money that doesnt need to be spent and thats supported by data See for yourself To be clear I think every worker who can work from home should have that option I understand not every job can be done remotely and not everyone who can WFH wants to However I also certainly dont think we should be moving backwards on labor issues and working conditions I think private sector workers should be able to WFH as well as state workers and that it is more likely for remote work to bounce back and start expanding again if entities like the State of California lead the way I hope this helps clear it up for you
