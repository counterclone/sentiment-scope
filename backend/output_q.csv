Sebastian Lee,You can find data on Environment Monitoring Center or Weather Forcasting Center in your city or country Besides you can find it on some APPs such as Moji Weather If you want to find the longrun data maybe you should go to the archive of the Bureau of Environment ProtectYou can find data on Environment Monitoring Center or Weather Forcasting Center in your city or countryBesides you can find it on some APPs such as Moji WeatherIf you want to find the longrun data maybe you should go to the archive of the Bureau of Environment Protect
Asit Ganguli,There is a massive challenge when it comes to detecting air pollution First we need to understand the kinds of pollution there arePhysical Pollutants also known as Particulate Matter consist of physical pollutant particles like dust human skin flakes pollen ash etc They are measured by size in Microns and are represented as PM or PM or PMChemical Pollutants also known as Volatile Organic Compounds consist of molecules of chemicals like Benzene Toulene Hydrogen Cyanide Ozone Formaldehyde Nitrogen Oxide etc They are measured in size by Angstrom  times smaller moreThere is a massive challenge when it comes to detecting air pollutionFirst we need to understand the kinds of pollution there arePhysical Pollutants also known as Particulate Matter consist of physical pollutant particles like dust human skin flakes pollen ash etc They are measured by size in Microns and are represented as PM or PM or PMChemical Pollutants also known as Volatile Organic Compounds consist of molecules of chemicals like Benzene Toulene Hydrogen Cyanide Ozone Formaldehyde Nitrogen Oxide etc They are measured in size by Angstrom  times smallermore
Oizom,Air pollution is measured using various methods and tools that track the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere Here are the key ways air pollution is measured  Particulate Matter PM MonitoringPM and PM These are particles in the air with diameters smaller than  micrometers PM and  micrometers PM They are the most commonly measured pollutantsMethods Gravimetric Method Collects particles on filters then weighs them to determine concentration Light Scattering and Absorption Measures the amount of light scattered or absorbed by particles in the air Gas P moreAir pollution is measured using various methods and tools that track the concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere Here are the key ways air pollution is measured Particulate Matter PM MonitoringPM and PM These are particles in the air with diameters smaller than  micrometers PM and  micrometers PM They are the most commonly measured pollutantsMethods Gravimetric Method Collects particles on filters then weighs them to determine concentration Light Scattering and Absorption Measures the amount of light scattered or absorbed by particles in the air Gas Pmore

Steve Drevik,For the US ignore the sources below because they are based on crap monitors There is a proliferation of air quality sites using data from horribly inaccurate pieces of junk that are slightly better than random number generators as they dont take into account the effects of humidity and temperature on the sensors they drift and they arent calibrated to any kind of standard But for a country like China it may be better than nothingYou want to go to a government EPA site that runs serious monitoring equipment that is calibrated audited and has a quality control systemFor the US t moreFor the US ignore the sources below because they are based on crap monitorsThere is a proliferation of air quality sites using data from horribly inaccurate pieces of junk that are slightly better than random number generators as they dont take into account the effects of humidity and temperature on the sensors they drift and they arent calibrated to any kind of standard But for a country like China it may be better than nothingYou want to go to a government EPA site that runs serious monitoring equipment that is calibrated audited and has a quality control systemFor the US tmore

Devesh Singhal,Ideally there must be a particle quality analysis for air That would identify from where pollution is really generated most Let me give one example When you drive your car the tyre goes flat after some time Where does its rubber go It breaks into small pieces and gets distributed in air Has someone considered this as a source of pollution No Unfortunately most of us have developed a habit of accusing a few known culprits industry stubble burning diwali crackers vehicle smoke and we are working on these points only Almost all industrial emission is being checked by having online moreIdeally there must be a particle quality analysis for air That would identify from where pollution is really generated most Let me give one exampleWhen you drive your car the tyre goes flat after some time Where does its rubber go It breaks into small pieces and gets distributed in air Has someone considered this as a source of pollution NoUnfortunately most of us have developed a habit of accusing a few known culprits industry stubble burning diwali crackers vehicle smoke and we are working on these points only Almost all industrial emission is being checked by having onlinemore
